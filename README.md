# Lab4_WebSys


This lab uses JavaScript to access information in a JSON file to recreate the HTML page in Lab 2. It uses the same CSS file as the aforementioned HTML page, using some of the same filler HTML -- notably the title section and the end section. From there it adds li elements.

It uses nested for loops to go through each element within the JSON file. It does this only after hiding the image of the cd that must be clicked on to access the playlist information.

The JSON file is semantically meaningful because it uses the class names (which were semantically meaningful to begin with) to identify the information kept within the li elements.
